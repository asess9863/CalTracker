# documentation
#### This is where I am going to record the developments of my app each day, hopefully this will be updated with each assignment/feature I add.

### day one 1/7/2026

there are many things that I worked on today. There might not be a lot on the canvas just yet but there are definitely a lot of ideas formulating during this process. I am enjoying seeing the direction this is taking. I have created a login page that I think look's quite alright for not knowing much. I also figured out how to link pages together so that I would be able to make it so when you choose use as a guest you would be redirected to the home page of the application. which will serve as the main hub for a majority of the calorie tracking and other various activities. Attached are screenshots of my expo page for each thing I have done.
